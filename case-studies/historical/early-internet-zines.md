# Early Internet Zines: 1990s Digital Publishing Culture

## Introduction

Before blogs. Before social media. Before Medium and Substack.

There were **zines**.

In the 1990s, as the Internet opened to the public, a generation of writers, artists, and misfits migrated their DIY publishing practices online. They brought punk's ethos, zine culture's aesthetics, and the early Web's anarchic spirit.

The result: **early Internet zines**—personal, raw, experimental digital publications that shaped online culture.

This case study examines the rise and legacy of 1990s Internet zines: their history, aesthetics, cultural impact, and what they can teach us about digital publishing today.

## What Were Zines?

### Print Zine History

**Zines** (from "magazines" or "fanzines") are self-published, small-circulation periodicals.

**Origins:**
- 1930s: Science fiction fanzines
- 1970s: Punk zines (*Sniffin' Glue*, 1976)
- 1980s-1990s: Riot Grrrl, personal zines explode

**Characteristics:**
- DIY production (photocopied, stapled)
- Personal, idiosyncratic content
- Small circulation (dozens to hundreds)
- Distributed by mail, at shows, in record stores
- Outside mainstream publishing

**Ethos:**
- Anyone can publish
- No gatekeepers
- Raw and authentic over polished
- Community over profit

### The Digital Migration (1990s)

When the Web emerged (1991), zine makers saw potential:

**Advantages of digital:**
- No printing costs
- Instant distribution
- Multimedia possibilities (images, sound, links)
- Global reach
- Easy updates

**But also:**
- Loss of physicality (no paper, no mail)
- Required technical skills (HTML)
- Different reading experience
- Ephemeral (sites disappear)

Many zine makers created **both** print and digital versions, or went fully digital.

## Decline and Transformation

### Why Early Internet Zines Faded

**1. Blogging platforms (1999+)**

- Monetization pressure
- "Content creation" replaced "zine making"

### What Was Lost

**Personal websites:**
- Unique, idiosyncratic spaces
