# Modern Zine Culture: Digital and Analog DIY Publishing

## Introduction

Zines never died—they evolved.

From photocopied punk manifestos in the 1970s to digital PDFs on itch.io in the 2020s, **zine culture persists**.

Today's zines are:
- Published on Gumroad, itch.io, Patreon
- Printed via POD (print-on-demand)
- Shared on Instagram, Tumblr, Mastodon
- Created with Risograph, laser printers, or digital tools
- Sold at zine fests, indie bookstores, online shops

This case study examines modern zine culture as contemporary aesthetic practice: the tools, the communities, the politics, and how DIY publishing resists corporate platforms.

"We don't need platforms to connect."

### Marginalized Voices

**Who makes zines:**

- Disabled folks
- Working-class people
- Youth

**Why:**
- Mainstream media excludes them
- Zines = self-representation
- Community = audience

**Message:**
"Our stories matter, even if publishers don't agree."
