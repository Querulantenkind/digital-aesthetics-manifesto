# On Choosing Difficult Tools

## The Paradox of Convenience

We live in an age of convenience. Everything is designed to be easier, faster, more intuitive. Interfaces hide complexity. Algorithms make decisions for us. Default settings "just work."

This is sold as progress. But convenience has a cost.

When tools become effortless, we lose:
- **Understanding** - We don't know how things work
- **Control** - We can't customize or repair
- **Skill** - We never develop mastery
- **Autonomy** - We depend on the tool's creators

This essay argues for choosing difficult tools—not out of masochism, but out of a commitment to understanding, agency, and craft.

## What Are "Difficult Tools"?

Difficult tools require:
- **Learning** - Steep learning curves, manuals, practice
- **Intention** - You must know what you want to do
- **Effort** - Actions require multiple steps
- **Understanding** - You need to know how they work

Examples:
- **Vim/Emacs** vs. Google Docs
- **Command line** vs. GUI file managers
- **LaTeX** vs. Microsoft Word
- **Git** vs. Dropbox
- **Linux** vs. macOS/Windows
- **Plain text** vs. proprietary formats

Difficult tools aren't "user-friendly" in the conventional sense. They're **practitioner-friendly**—rewarding to those who invest time.

## Why Choose Difficulty?

### 1. Understanding Over Abstraction

Convenient tools hide how they work. This is abstraction—useful, but limiting.

**Easy tool:**  
Click "Save" → File is saved (where? how? in what format? you don't know)

**Difficult tool:**  
`git add file.txt` → `git commit -m "message"` → `git push origin main`  
You understand: staging, commits, branches, remotes

With difficult tools, **you know what's happening**. This knowledge is power.

### 2. Control Over Convenience

Convenient tools offer limited options—the designers decided what you need.

**Easy tool:**  
"Bold" button, "Italic" button, preset styles

**Difficult tool:**  
Markdown, LaTeX, CSS—infinite customization

Difficult tools give you **control**, not just choices.

### 3. Mastery Over Ease

Difficult tools reward learning. Initial frustration becomes eventual fluency.

**Easy tool:**  
Day 1: Easy  
Year 1: Still easy (but no faster)

**Difficult tool:**  
Day 1: Frustrating  
Year 1: Effortlessly fast (and you can do things others can't)

Mastery is satisfying in ways convenience can never be.

### 4. Longevity Over Trendiness

Difficult tools tend to last. Easy tools get replaced.

**Easy tools:**  
- Sunset when platforms change
- Break when companies fold
- Require constant updates

**Difficult tools:**  
- Vim: 30+ years old, still maintained
- LaTeX: 40+ years old, still the standard for academic publishing
- Unix command line: 50+ years old, still essential

Learning difficult tools is an investment that pays dividends for decades.

### 5. Community Over Corporation

Difficult tools are often:
- **Open source** - Maintained by communities
- **Free** - No subscription, no vendor lock-in
- **Extensible** - Users contribute improvements

Easy tools are often:
- **Proprietary** - Controlled by companies
- **Monetized** - You're the product or paying subscription fees
- **Locked down** - You can't modify or extend them

Difficult tools align with values of autonomy and sharing.

## The Cost of Convenience

What do we lose when we prioritize ease?

### Learned Helplessness
When tools "just work," we never learn to fix them when they break. We become dependent on:
- Customer support
- The company staying in business
- Updates not breaking things

We lose **agency**.

### Loss of Craft
Craft requires:
- Deep knowledge
- Practiced skill
- Attention to detail

Convenient tools automate craft away. They produce "good enough" results without requiring mastery.

The difference between a Photoshop template and a carefully crafted illustration.  
The difference between a WordPress theme and hand-written HTML/CSS.  
The difference between autocorrect and knowing grammar.

**Convenience eliminates the learning that produces excellence.**

### Surveillance and Control
Convenient tools often:
- Require accounts (tracking)
- Store data in the cloud (surveillance)
- Update automatically (loss of control)
- Lock you into ecosystems

Difficult tools, by contrast:
- Run locally
- Use open formats
- Require intentional updates
- Interoperate with other tools

**Convenience often means surrendering privacy and autonomy.**

## Difficulty as Aesthetic

Choosing difficult tools is an aesthetic stance:

### The Aesthetics of Effort
- The satisfaction of a well-crafted `git` workflow
- The beauty of a perfectly aligned LaTeX document
- The elegance of a efficient shell script
- The pleasure of keyboard shortcuts committed to muscle memory

**Effort produces beauty that shortcuts cannot.**

### The Aesthetics of Understanding
When you understand how something works:
- You appreciate its design
- You can repair and extend it
- You feel ownership, not just usage

**Knowledge is aesthetic.**

### The Aesthetics of Constraint
Difficult tools often have limitations that force creativity:
- Vim has modes → forces intentional editing
- Markdown has minimal formatting → focuses on content
- Command line is text-only → encourages precision

**Constraints produce discipline, and discipline produces craft.**

---

## Difficult Tools as Politics

Choosing difficult tools is also political:

### Against Planned Obsolescence
Easy tools are often replaced. Difficult tools are maintained.

Choosing difficult tools is choosing **sustainability** over consumption.

### Against Surveillance Capitalism
Easy tools track you. Difficult tools (often) don't.

Choosing difficult tools is choosing **privacy** over convenience.

### Against Monopoly
Easy tools create vendor lock-in. Difficult tools use open standards.

Choosing difficult tools is choosing **freedom** over dependence.

### Against Deskilling
Easy tools reduce the need for expertise. Difficult tools require it.

Choosing difficult tools is choosing **craft** over automation.

## How to Choose Difficulty Wisely

Not all difficulty is valuable. Some tools are just badly designed.

**Good difficulty:**
- Rewards learning with increased capability
- Has clear documentation and community support
- Uses consistent, logical principles
- Empowers users over time

**Bad difficulty:**
- Arbitrary complexity without benefit
- Poor documentation or hostile community
- Inconsistent behavior
- Creates dependency without payoff

Choose tools that are **hard to learn but easy to master**, not tools that are just frustrating.

## Practical Examples

### Writing
**Easy:** Google Docs, Microsoft Word  
**Difficult:** Vim + Markdown, LaTeX, plain text

**Payoff:** Control over formatting, portability, longevity, no vendor lock-in

### Version Control
**Easy:** Dropbox, Google Drive  
**Difficult:** Git

**Payoff:** Understanding history, branching, collaboration; essential for professional development

### Email
**Easy:** Gmail web interface  
**Difficult:** Mutt, Neomutt, plain text email

**Payoff:** Privacy, speed, offline access, scriptable workflows

### Photo Editing
**Easy:** Instagram filters, smartphone apps  
**Difficult:** GIMP, Photoshop, Darktable

**Payoff:** Precise control, non-destructive editing, professional results

## Balancing Difficulty and Pragmatism

You don't have to use difficult tools for everything.

**Use difficult tools when:**
- You do the task frequently (investment pays off)
- You need precise control
- You value understanding how it works
- Privacy or longevity matters

**Use easy tools when:**
- It's a one-time task
- Results matter more than process
- Collaboration requires it
- Time is limited

The point isn't **purity**—it's **intentionality**.

## Teaching Difficulty

If difficult tools are valuable, how do we make them accessible?

### Good Documentation
- Clear, well-structured tutorials
- Examples and use cases
- Troubleshooting guides

### Patient Communities
- Welcoming to beginners
- Answering questions without condescension
- Sharing configurations and workflows

### Gradual On-Ramps
- Start with basic features
- Introduce complexity incrementally
- Celebrate small victories

**Difficulty should be rewarding, not gatekeeping.**

---

## Conclusion

Choosing difficult tools is an act of resistance and commitment.

It says:
- **I value understanding** over convenience
- **I choose craft** over automation
- **I claim agency** over dependence
- **I invest in longevity** over trends

Difficult tools are not for everyone, all the time. But they offer something easy tools cannot: **mastery**.

The satisfaction of competence.  
The power of understanding.  
The autonomy of control.

In a world that makes everything easy, choosing difficulty is radical.

Choose your tools intentionally.  
Learn them deeply.  
Master them over time.

**The hard way is often the better way.**
