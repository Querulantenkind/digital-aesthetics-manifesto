# Manifesto of Resistance

## We Resist

We live in an age of:
- Ubiquitous surveillance
- Algorithmic control
- Corporate dominance
- Planned obsolescence
- Attention extraction
- Identity commodification

**We refuse to accept this as inevitable.**

Technology is not neutral. Every tool embodies choices, values, power relations.

**We resist.**

Not by rejecting technology, but by **building alternatives**.  
Not by complaining, but by **creating**.  
Not by opting out, but by **opting in to different systems**.

**This is our manifesto of resistance.**

## I. We Resist Surveillance

**The Problem:**

Every click is tracked.  
Every purchase is recorded.  
Every message is scanned.  
Every location is logged.

**Surveillance capitalism** (Zuboff):
- Your behavior is the product
- Prediction is the goal
- Control is the endgame

**We resist by:**

**1. Using encryption**
- End-to-end encrypted messaging (Signal, Matrix)
- Encrypted email (ProtonMail, Tutanota)
- Full-disk encryption
- HTTPS everywhere

**2. Blocking trackers**
- Browser extensions (uBlock Origin, Privacy Badger)
- DNS filtering (Pi-hole)
- VPNs and Tor
- Disable JavaScript when possible

**3. Minimizing data exposure**
- Use pseudonyms
- Provide minimal personal information
- Separate contexts (different emails for different purposes)
- Delete accounts and data regularly

**4. Supporting privacy-respecting alternatives**
- DuckDuckGo over Google
- Signal over WhatsApp
- Mastodon over Twitter/X
- Self-hosted services when possible

**Resistance is:**
- Choosing tools that respect privacy
- Making surveillance expensive
- Normalizing encryption ("I have nothing to hide" is compliance)

---

## II. We Resist Proprietary Control

**The Problem:**

Software is closed.  
Formats are locked.  
Platforms are walled gardens.  
Users are prisoners.

**Vendor lock-in:**
- Can't export your data
- Can't switch tools
- Can't understand how it works
- Can't modify it
- Can't preserve it

**We resist by:**

**1. Using open source software**
- Linux over Windows/macOS
- LibreOffice over Microsoft Office
- GIMP over Photoshop
- Firefox over Chrome

**2. Using open formats**
- Plain text over Word docs
- Markdown over rich text
- CSV over Excel
- SVG over proprietary graphics

**3. Self-hosting**
- Personal servers (Raspberry Pi, VPS)
- Email (Postfix, Dovecot)
- Cloud storage (Nextcloud)
- Git (self-hosted Gitea/Forgejo)

**4. Contributing to open source**
- Code contributions
- Documentation
- Bug reports
- Financial support

**Resistance is:**
- Own your tools
- Control your data
- Understand your systems
- Share your knowledge

---

## III. We Resist Planned Obsolescence

**The Problem:**

Hardware breaks after warranty.  
Software stops working (updates break it).  
Formats become unreadable.  
"New version" means "buy again."

**Planned obsolescence:**
- Devices that can't be repaired
- Software that requires latest OS
- File formats that change
- Artificial limitations (battery, memory)

**We resist by:**

**1. Using durable tools**
- Text editors that've existed for decades (Vim, Emacs)
- Plain text (will work forever)
- Simple formats (HTML, CSS)
- Stable protocols (HTTP, SMTP, SSH)

**2. Repairing and maintaining**
- Fix rather than replace
- Learn repair skills
- Support right-to-repair legislation
- Buy repairable hardware (Framework laptop, Fairphone)

**3. Running old hardware**
- Lightweight Linux distros on old computers
- Terminal tools (not resource-hungry)
- Static sites (no server requirements)
- Minimize dependencies

**4. Archiving and preserving**
- Plain text archives
- Multiple backups (3-2-1 rule: 3 copies, 2 media, 1 offsite)
- Open formats (future-proof)
- Documentation

**Resistance is:**
- Build things that last
- Use things until they break (truly break)
- Preserve knowledge
- Reject upgrade culture

---

## IV. We Resist Algorithmic Control

**The Problem:**

Algorithms decide:
- What you see (feeds)
- What you know (search results)
- Who you connect with (recommendations)
- What you buy (suggestions)

**Algorithmic control:**
- Optimized for engagement (not well-being)
- Opaque (black box)
- Manipulative (A/B testing your psychology)
- Addictive (infinite scroll, autoplay)

**We resist by:**

**1. Choosing chronological over algorithmic**
- RSS feeds (you control what you subscribe to)
- Email newsletters (direct, no algorithm)
- Mastodon (chronological, no ads)
- Old-school forums (threads, not feeds)

**2. Disabling recommendations**
- Turn off YouTube autoplay
- Ignore "People You May Know"
- Reject "Because You Watched"
- Curate, don't consume

**3. Using tools that respect attention**
- News readers (you decide when to read)
- Pocket/Instapaper (save for later, batch reading)
- Plain text files (no notifications)

**4. Setting boundaries**
- No notifications (pull, don't push)
- Scheduled checking (not constant monitoring)
- Separate devices for different purposes
- Digital sabbaths (tech-free time)

**Resistance is:**
- You decide what you consume
- You control your attention
- You set the pace
- You are not the product

---

## V. We Resist Monopolization

**The Problem:**

Five companies control everything:
- Google (search, ads, Android, Chrome, YouTube)
- Apple (iOS, App Store, hardware)
- Microsoft (Windows, Office, GitHub, Azure)
- Amazon (retail, AWS, cloud)
- Meta (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp)

**Monopoly power:**
- Can't avoid them
- No real competition
- Can change terms unilaterally
- Extract rent (30% App Store tax, etc.)

**We resist by:**

**1. Using alternatives**
- Mastodon, Pixelfed (decentralized social media)
- PeerTube (decentralized video)
- OpenStreetMap (community mapping)
- Indie bookstores, not Amazon

**2. Supporting decentralization**
- Fediverse (ActivityPub protocol)
- IPFS (distributed file system)
- Peer-to-peer protocols (BitTorrent, Dat/Hyper)
- Mesh networks

**3. Building small**
- Personal websites, not platforms
- Small communities, not massive networks
- Human-scale, not global-scale
- Local-first software

**4. Paying for services (not being the product)**
- Donations to open source
- Pay for email (ProtonMail, Fastmail)
- Support independent creators (Patreon, Ko-fi)
- Buy from small businesses

**Resistance is:**
- Decentralization over centralization
- Many small things over few big things
- Community ownership over corporate control
- Interoperability over lock-in

---

## VI. We Resist the Attention Economy

**The Problem:**

Your attention is for sale:
- Infinite feeds (never finish)
- Autoplay videos (can't stop)
- Notifications (constant interruptions)
- Gamification (points, streaks, badges)

**Attention economy:**
- Your focus is the resource
- Ads are the product
- Engagement is the metric
- Addiction is the goal

**We resist by:**

**1. Protecting attention**
- Turn off all notifications
- No social media apps on phone
- Website blockers during focus time
- Pomodoro technique (focused work blocks)

**2. Choosing finite over infinite**
- Books (have endings)
- Albums (finite tracks)
- RSS feeds (you reach the end)
- Email (inbox zero is possible)

**3. Creating more, consuming less**
- Write instead of scroll
- Code instead of watch
- Draw instead of browse
- Make instead of consume

**4. Scheduling consumption**
- Check email twice daily (not constantly)
- Read news once daily (not constantly)
- Social media once weekly (or never)
- Batching, not streaming

**Resistance is:**
- Your time is valuable
- Your attention is limited
- Your focus is precious
- You decide where it goes

---

## VII. We Resist Opacity

**The Problem:**

Everything is a black box:
- Can't see the code
- Can't understand the algorithm
- Can't verify claims
- Can't trust closed systems

**Opacity:**
- "Trust us" (but we can't verify)
- "It's proprietary" (you can't see)
- "Trade secrets" (you can't know)
- "Terms and conditions" (you can't negotiate)

**We resist by:**

**1. Demanding transparency**
- Open source (see the code)
- Public audits (third-party verification)
- Clear documentation (understand how it works)
- Explainability (no black-box algorithms)

**2. Using verifiable tools**
- PGP/GPG encryption (mathematically verifiable)
- Bitcoin/cryptocurrency (transparent ledger)
- Open protocols (SMTP, HTTP, SSH—you can implement them yourself)

**3. Learning how things work**
- Read the source code
- Understand the protocols
- Study the systems
- Question the claims

**4. Building transparent alternatives**
- Document everything
- Open source by default
- Clear, honest communication
- No dark patterns

**Resistance is:**
- Transparency over secrecy
- Verification over trust
- Understanding over blind faith
- Open over closed

---

## VIII. We Resist the Monoculture

**The Problem:**

Everything looks the same:
- Every website (same frameworks, same design)
- Every app (same UX patterns)
- Every social media (same feeds, same features)
- Every device (same OS, same apps)

**Monoculture:**
- Homogenization
- Loss of diversity
- Fragility (one vulnerability affects all)
- Boring

**We resist by:**

**1. Embracing diversity**
- Different tools for different tasks
- Different designs for different contexts
- Different approaches for different problems
- Experimentation

**2. Supporting small, weird, independent**
- Indie games (not AAA titles)
- Personal websites (not Medium posts)
- Self-published zines (not mainstream media)
- Unique tools (not just "X but better")

**3. Building from scratch**
- Write your own tools (even if others exist)
- Design your own interfaces
- Create your own workflows
- Explore alternatives

**4. Resisting "best practices"**
- Question conventions
- Try unconventional approaches
- Allow for failure
- Value the weird

**Resistance is:**
- Diversity strengthens
- Monoculture weakens
- Weird is good
- Different is valuable

---

## IX. We Resist Passivity

**The Problem:**

We've become consumers, not creators:
- Watch, don't make
- Use, don't build
- Consume, don't contribute
- Complain, don't act

**Passivity:**
- Waiting for someone else to fix it
- Helplessness and dependency
- Accepting the given options
- "I can't do anything about it"

**We resist by:**

**1. Creating**
- Write code
- Write essays
- Make art
- Build tools

**2. Contributing**
- Open source contributions
- Documentation
- Helping others learn
- Sharing knowledge

**3. Teaching**
- Workshops and tutorials
- Mentoring
- Writing guides
- Explaining to beginners

**4. Organizing**
- Local meetups
- Online communities
- Collaborative projects
- Collective action

**Resistance is:**
- Active, not passive
- Creating, not just consuming
- Building, not just using
- Doing, not just watching

---

## X. We Resist Despair

**The Problem:**

It's easy to feel hopeless:
- Corporations too powerful
- Surveillance too pervasive
- Problems too big
- "Nothing I do matters"

**Despair:**
- Paralysis
- Cynicism
- Giving up
- Nihilism

**We resist by:**

**1. Taking small actions**
- One person using encryption matters
- One website with plain text matters
- One open source contribution matters
- Many small actions = movement

**2. Building community**
- You're not alone
- Others are resisting too
- Share stories and strategies
- Support each other

**3. Celebrating wins**
- Linux succeeded
- Wikipedia exists
- Creative Commons is used
- Tor works

**4. Staying hopeful**
- Alternatives are possible
- Change is happening
- Resistance works
- Keep going

**Resistance is:**
- Hope is political
- Action defeats despair
- Community sustains us
- Keep resisting

## Why Resistance Matters

### 1. Power Can Be Challenged

Corporations are not invincible:
- Microsoft lost browser dominance (Firefox, Chrome)
- Wikipedia beat Encarta
- Linux runs most servers
- Encryption is legal (for now) and works

**Resistance works.**

### 2. Alternatives Are Possible

The current system is not inevitable:
- Open source exists and thrives
- Decentralized networks work (Mastodon, IPFS)
- Privacy-respecting tools are available
- People build alternatives

**We can build different futures.**

### 3. Individual Actions Aggregate

One person switching to Linux: small.  
Millions switching: market shift.

One person using Signal: useful.  
Everyone using Signal: normalizes encryption.

**Your resistance matters.**

### 4. Resistance Builds Skills

Learning to resist teaches:
- Technical skills (Linux, encryption, coding)
- Critical thinking (question defaults)
- Self-reliance (build your own tools)
- Community (find allies)

**Resistance makes you stronger.**

### 5. Hope Is Contagious

When you resist, others see it's possible:
- "If they can do it, maybe I can too"
- Normalize alternatives
- Build momentum
- Inspire action

**Your resistance inspires others.**

## Conclusion

**We live in systems designed to:**
- Extract value
- Control behavior
- Maximize profit
- Minimize autonomy

**But these systems are not natural. They are chosen.**

**And we can choose differently.**

**We resist:**
- Not by opting out
- But by building alternatives
- Not by complaining
- But by creating
- Not by waiting
- But by acting now

**Resistance is:**
- Using encryption
- Choosing open source
- Building things that last
- Protecting attention
- Supporting alternatives
- Teaching others
- Staying hopeful

**Resistance is not futile.**

**Resistance is necessary.**

**Resist. Create. Persist.**
