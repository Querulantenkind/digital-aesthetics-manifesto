# Manifesto of Text

## We Declare

**Text is not merely functional. Text is beautiful.**

In an age of images, videos, and virtual reality—we assert that **plain text** is a legitimate aesthetic medium. Not primitive. Not outdated. Not inferior.

Beautiful.

---

## I. Text Is Universal

Text renders on any device, any screen, any system.  
Text doesn't break when browsers update.  
Text works on $20 phones and $2000 laptops alike.  
Text is accessible to screen readers, to search engines, to humans.

**We reject technologies that privilege the wealthy and exclude the marginalized.**

Text is the great equalizer.

---

## II. Text Is Durable

A text file from 1975 opens today.  
ASCII art from 1980 still renders.  
Plain text doesn't have "end of life" dates.  
Your .docx files will be unreadable in 20 years. Your .txt files will outlive you.

**We reject planned obsolescence and format lock-in.**

Text endures.

---

## III. Text Is Efficient

Text files are tiny. Kilobytes, not megabytes.  
Text loads instantly.  
Text uses minimal bandwidth, minimal energy, minimal resources.  
Text doesn't drain batteries or overheat CPUs.

**We reject bloat and wastefulness.**

Text is lean.

---

## IV. Text Is Private

Text files don't phone home.  
Text doesn't embed tracking pixels.  
Text doesn't report your reading habits.  
Text doesn't require surveillance to function.

**We reject technologies that treat users as products.**

Text respects you.

---

## V. Text Is Expressive

ASCII art exists. Concrete poetry exists. Code as literature exists.  
Markdown is elegant. LaTeX is precise. Plain text is versatile.  
Typography is an art. Layout conveys meaning. Whitespace speaks volumes.

**We reject the notion that expression requires images or multimedia.**

Text is sufficient.

---

## VI. Text Is Intentional

Writing text requires thought.  
Reading text requires attention.  
Text doesn't autoplay, doesn't distract, doesn't manipulate.  
Text respects the reader's time and agency.

**We reject algorithmic feeds and infinite scroll.**

Text is deliberate.

---

## VII. Text Is Collective

Text can be copied freely.  
Text can be quoted and remixed.  
Text can be translated, annotated, and improved.  
Text belongs to everyone and no one.

**We reject DRM, paywalls, and artificial scarcity.**

Text is commons.

---

## VIII. Text Is Political

To choose plain text is to resist surveillance capitalism.  
To use plaintext is to reject proprietary formats.  
To create with text is to assert autonomy.  
To share text freely is to practice solidarity.

**We reject technologies designed for control.**

Text is liberation.

## We Practice

1. **We write in plain text** - Markdown, Org-mode, .txt files
2. **We publish openly** - HTML, not PDFs; public, not paywalled
3. **We archive locally** - Own your data; distrust the cloud
4. **We use semantic markup** - Structure that means something
5. **We choose open formats** - Readable by anyone, forever
6. **We respect typography** - Readability, accessibility, beauty
7. **We minimize metadata** - Privacy through simplicity
8. **We teach others** - Text literacy is digital literacy

---

## We Build

- Documentation that lasts decades
- Interfaces that respect users
- Archives that resist corporate decay
- Culture that values craft over convenience
- Community that shares knowledge freely

---

## We Resist

- Proprietary file formats that lock users in
- Surveillance technologies that monetize attention
- Platforms that treat writing as engagement metrics
- Tools that prioritize features over functionality
- Systems that make simplicity seem impossible

---

## The Beauty of Text

Text is:
- The cursor blinking on a blank screen
- The satisfying snap of a monospace grid
- The rhythm of well-structured prose
- The elegance of a carefully crafted sentence
- The power of an idea expressed clearly

Text doesn't need decoration.  
Text doesn't need apologizing for.  
Text **is**.

---

## Our Commitment

We commit to:
- Creating beautiful, functional text-based works
- Sharing knowledge through plain text
- Teaching others the power of simplicity
- Building tools that respect text as a medium
- Defending the right to read and write without surveillance

---

## Conclusion

This manifesto is written in Markdown.  
It's 3 kilobytes.  
It will render in any text editor, on any computer, forever.

No tracking.  
No paywalls.  
No planned obsolescence.

Just text.

And that's enough.
