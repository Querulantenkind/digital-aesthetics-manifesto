# Core Concepts: A Vocabulary for Digital Aesthetics

## Introduction

Every field needs its vocabulary. This document defines the core concepts, terms, and ideas that structure the Digital Aesthetics Manifesto. These are the building blocks for understanding how we think about beauty, technology, identity, and resistance in digital spaces.

---

## Part I: Aesthetics

### Digital Aesthetics
The philosophy and practice of beauty, functionality, and meaning-making in computational media. Not just "how things look on screens" but a comprehensive approach to creating and experiencing digital works.

### Constraint-Based Aesthetics
Beauty and creativity that emerge from limitations rather than despite them. ASCII art, chiptune music, and terminal interfaces exemplify how restrictions can focus and enhance creative expression.

### Terminal Aesthetics
The visual and philosophical style associated with text-based command-line interfaces: monospace fonts, limited colors, text-only display, grid-based layout. Values clarity, efficiency, and directness.

### Text-as-Material
Treating text not as transparent medium but as a substance with its own properties: encoding, structure, typography, spatial arrangement. Emphasizes text as the fundamental material of digital culture.

### Minimalism (Digital)
Design philosophy that removes everything unnecessary. In digital contexts: plain text over formatted documents, simple interfaces over complex features, functionality over decoration.

### Brutalism (Digital)
Web/interface design that embraces:
- Raw, exposed structure (visible HTML)
- Harsh contrasts and limited color
- Anti-commercial aesthetics
- Honesty about function over polish

Examples: Craigslist, Hacker News, early web aesthetics

### Retrofuturism
Nostalgic visions of the future through past aesthetics:
- Vaporwave (80s/90s commercial imagery)
- Y2K aesthetics (late 90s/early 2000s design)
- Synthwave (neon grids and chrome)
- Terminal aesthetics (green screens, command lines)

### Glitch Aesthetics
Embracing errors, artifacts, and breakdown as aesthetic elements:
- Corruption as art
- Compression artifacts
- Databending
- Celebrating malfunction

## Part II: Text and Typography

### ASCII
American Standard Code for Information Interchange. 7-bit character encoding (128 characters), of which 95 are printable. The foundation of digital text.

### ASCII Art
Images created using only ASCII characters. Requires monospace fonts and spatial arrangement to create pictorial representations.

### Unicode
Character encoding standard supporting 149,186+ characters, including all world languages, mathematical symbols, emoji, and more. Extends ASCII while maintaining backward compatibility.

### Monospace Font
Typeface where every character occupies the same width. Essential for ASCII art, code, and terminal interfaces. Examples: Courier, Source Code Pro, Fira Code.

### Plain Text
Unformatted text files (.txt) containing only characters without styling, layout, or embedded objects. Human-readable, universal, durable.

### Markdown
Lightweight markup language using plain text syntax to indicate formatting:

```markdown
# Heading
**Bold** and *italic*
[Link](url)
```

Readable as plain text, convertible to HTML and other formats.

### Semantic Markup
HTML/XML that conveys *meaning*, not just appearance:
- `<em>` for emphasis, not just italics
- `<strong>` for importance, not just bold
- `<h1>` for top-level heading, not just large text

## Part III: Anonymity and Identity

### Anonymity
The state of being unnamed, unidentified, or untraceable. In digital contexts: operating without persistent identification or linking to offline identity.

### Pseudonymity
Using a persistent but non-real name (pseudonym). Allows reputation building without revealing offline identity. Examples: usernames, handles, pen names.

### Real Name Policy
Platform requirement that users provide and display legal names. Criticized for:
- Endangering marginalized users
- Enabling surveillance
- Erasing cultural naming practices
- Serving corporate data collection

### Doxxing
Malicious publication of someone's private identifying information (real name, address, phone, employer) without consent. Form of harassment and intimidation.

### Contextual Integrity
Helen Nissenbaum's framework: privacy is about appropriate information flow in specific contexts. What's appropriate to share varies by relationship, setting, and norms.

### Multiplicity of Self
Recognition that individuals contain multiple, context-dependent identities rather than a single "authentic self." Anonymity and pseudonymity enable healthy identity multiplicity.

### Persistent Identity
Identity that remains constant across contexts and time. Online platforms increasingly demand this; anonymity resists it.

## Part IV: Surveillance and Resistance

### Surveillance Capitalism
Shoshana Zuboff's term for economic system where:
1. Human experience is extracted as raw material
2. Behavioral data is processed into prediction products
3. Predictions are sold to influence behavior
4. Profit depends on ubiquitous, inescapable surveillance

### Chilling Effect
Self-censorship resulting from awareness of surveillance. People avoid legitimate activities (searches, speech, organizing) due to fear of being watched.

### Encryption
Mathematical transformation of data to make it unreadable without a key. Types:
- **End-to-end** - Only sender and recipient can read (Signal)
- **In-transit** - Protected during transmission (HTTPS)
- **At-rest** - Protected when stored

### Metadata
Data about data. Often more revealing than content:
- Who you contact and when (email metadata)
- Location history (phone metadata)
- Search queries (even if not the clicked results)

### Tor (The Onion Router)
Network that anonymizes internet traffic by routing through multiple encrypted relays. Makes it difficult to trace activity to specific users or locations.

### Threat Modeling
Process of identifying:
- What you're protecting (data, identity, activity)
- Who you're protecting from (corporations, governments, individuals)
- What capabilities they have (surveillance, hacking, legal power)
- What you're willing to sacrifice (convenience, features)

Different threat models require different protective measures.

## Part V: Technology and Politics

### Free Software / Open Source
Software with publicly available source code. Users have freedom to:
- Run the program for any purpose
- Study and modify the code
- Redistribute copies
- Distribute modified versions

Values: transparency, user control, community ownership.

### Proprietary Software
Software with restricted source code, controlled by the owner. Users typically cannot modify, redistribute, or study how it works.

### Planned Obsolescence
Deliberate design of products to become obsolete or unusable:
- File formats that require specific software versions
- Hardware that cannot be repaired
- Features removed in updates
- Software "end of life" dates

### Vendor Lock-In
Business strategy that makes switching away from a product difficult or costly:
- Proprietary file formats
- Platform-specific features
- Data export restrictions
- Network effects (everyone else uses it)

### Interoperability
Ability of different systems to work together using open standards and protocols. Enables choice, competition, and user freedom.

### Convivial Tools
Ivan Illich's term for technologies that enhance human capability without creating dependencies. Opposite of industrial tools that require specialists and corporations.

## Part VI: Community and Culture

### Anonymous Community
Group where persistent identity is not required. Members may post without usernames; contributions judged on merit rather than author's reputation.

### Pseudonymous Community
Group where participants use consistent pseudonyms. Reputation can develop, but linked to chosen names rather than legal identities.

### Imageboard
Website (often anonymous) where users post images and comments in threads. Examples: 4chan, 8chan, Futaba Channel. Known for both creativity and toxicity.

### BBS (Bulletin Board System)
Pre-internet dial-up communities (1980s-1990s). Users connected via modem to exchange messages, files, and games. Early example of online community.

### IRC (Internet Relay Chat)
Text-based real-time chat protocol. Pseudonymous, organized into channels. Still used by many technical and hacker communities.

### Demoscene
Community creating audiovisual art ("demos") under technical constraints:
- Strict file size limits (64KB, 4KB, 256 bytes)
- Hardware-specific (Commodore 64, DOS, modern PCs)
- Procedurally generated, no external assets

Values technical prowess and artistic expression equally.

### Zine Culture
DIY self-publishing outside commercial channels:
- Print zines: photocopied, hand-distributed
- Digital zines: PDFs, HTML, plain text files
- Distributed through communities, not stores

Emphasizes:
- Accessibility over profit
- Personal voice over professional polish
- Community over mass audience

## Part VII: Design Principles

### Accessibility
Design that works for everyone:
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation
- Sufficient color contrast
- Readable font sizes
- Clear language

Accessibility is not optional—it's ethical design.

### Performance
How efficiently software uses resources:
- **Speed** - Load times, responsiveness
- **Bandwidth** - Data transferred
- **CPU/memory** - Processing requirements
- **Energy** - Battery drain, environmental impact

Good design is performant design.

### Longevity
How well technology endures over time:
- Plain text files: decades
- Proprietary formats: until software is discontinued
- Web standards: long-lasting if followed
- Physical media: degrades

Design for longevity means using open, stable formats.

### Intentionality
Deliberate, considered choices rather than defaults:
- Choosing tools based on values, not convenience
- Understanding what you're using and why
- Resisting "automatic" or "smart" features that remove agency

### Essentialism
Stripping away everything unnecessary:
- What is the *minimum* required?
- What can be removed without loss?
- What clarifies rather than decorates?

Less is often more.

## Part VIII: Creative Practices

### Remix Culture
Creating by appropriating, modifying, and recombining existing works:
- Memes as remixed images/videos
- Fanfiction as remixed narratives
- Sampling in music
- Fork and modify in open source

Value: nothing is created in isolation; culture is collective.

### Generative Art
Art created through algorithms or procedural systems:
- Rule-based output (Conway's Game of Life)
- Randomness within parameters
- Interactive or responsive systems

Artist sets conditions; the system generates variations.

### Code as Art / Code Poetry
Using code for aesthetic rather than functional purposes:
- Beautiful algorithms appreciated for elegance
- Programs that generate poetry or visual art
- Obfuscated code as puzzle or joke
- Comments as marginalia or narrative

### Documentation as Art
Treating documentation as creative practice:
- README files as manifestos
- Man pages as literature
- API docs as designed experiences
- Comments as collaborative storytelling

### Constraint-Based Creation
Making work within deliberate limitations:
- Write a story in exactly 100 words
- Create ASCII art using only 10 characters
- Design a website with no JavaScript
- Make music with 8-bit sound chips

Constraints focus creativity and produce distinctive results.
