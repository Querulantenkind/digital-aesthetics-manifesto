# Terminal Landscapes

**Curated by**: Digital Aesthetics Manifesto Community  
**Opening**: November 19, 2025  
**Theme**: Natural and urban landscapes rendered in ASCII

## Curatorial Statement

ASCII art traditionally excels at rendering objects, faces, and symbols. But what about landscapes—those expansive vistas requiring depth, atmosphere, and subtle gradations of light? This exhibition explores how artists use the limited palette of text characters to evoke mountains, forests, cities, and skies.

The works here demonstrate various techniques: density gradients for depth, character selection for texture, composition for scale, and negative space for atmosphere. Some pieces are realistic, attempting photographic fidelity. Others are impressionistic, capturing mood over detail. All share the challenge of suggesting space and distance with characters originally designed for typing words.

Landscapes in ASCII remind us that limitation and representation are always in tension—and that this tension can be productive, even beautiful.

**Artist**: Anonymous  
**Date**: 1994  
**Dimensions**: 80×18 characters  
**Technique**: Density gradient using punctuation marks  
**Character set**: ASCII printable characters

**Notes**: This classic piece uses increasing density of punctuation marks (. : ! ^) to suggest the silhouette of mountain peaks against a dawn sky. The jagged base line reinforces the alpine character.

**Artist**: jgs (Joan G. Stark)  
**Date**: 1998  
**Dimensions**: 40×20 characters  
**Technique**: Line-based tree construction  
**Character set**: ASCII printable

**Notes**: Joan Stark's characteristic style—clean, geometric, instantly readable. The repetition of tree forms creates depth, while the tildes suggest undergrowth and the grave accents indicate a distant horizon.

**Artist**: Anonymous  
**Date**: 1995  
**Dimensions**: 68×12 characters  
**Technique**: Character spacing and density  
**Character set**: Tilde only

**Notes**: Minimalist approach using only the tilde character. Varying densities and spacing create the impression of waves, demonstrating that sometimes a single character can be enough.

**Artist**: Unknown  
**Date**: 1997  
**Dimensions**: 52×17 characters  
**Technique**: Geometric line art with texture

**Dimensions**: 45×20 characters

## Technical Considerations

### Creating Landscape ASCII Art

**Depth through density**: Foreground objects use denser characters (#, @, M) while background uses sparser ones (., :, ;)

**Atmospheric perspective**: More detail in foreground, less in background. Spacing can suggest haze or distance.

**Character selection matters**:
- Mountains: ^ / \ { } < > for peaks and ridges
- Water: ~ - = for waves and ripples  
- Trees: | / \ for trunks and branches
- Sky: . : * for stars, clouds, texture
- Buildings: | - + for straight lines and corners

**Composition**: Use the full frame. Landscapes benefit from horizontal formats that mirror human field of vision.

**Scale**: Suggest scale through relative sizes, not absolute rendering. A small tree next to a mountain tells the viewer the mountain is huge.

---

## Historical Context

Landscape ASCII art emerged in BBS culture as "signature" art—users would create scenic signatures for their posts. Early examples were simple (a row of tildes for water, a /\ for a mountain peak). 

As artists refined techniques, more complex scenes became possible: Joan Stark's landscapes from the late 1990s set a standard for detail and composition. The tradition continues with contemporary ASCII artists creating increasingly sophisticated environmental scenes.

Interestingly, landscape ASCII art often attempts realism—unlike ASCII portraits which tend toward caricature, or ASCII logos which embrace geometric simplification. Perhaps because landscapes don't have "correct" proportions, artists feel freer to experiment with technique.
