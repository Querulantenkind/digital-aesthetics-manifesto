# Text as Architecture

**Curated by**: Digital Aesthetics Manifesto Community  
**Opening**: November 19, 2025  
**Theme**: Buildings, monuments, and machines rendered as structure

## Curatorial Statement

Architecture and ASCII are natural partners. Both are fundamentally about structure—how elements stack, connect, support. Both work with grids, modules, repetition. And both must balance function with aesthetics.

ASCII "architecture" ranges from simple houses to elaborate castles, from bridges to spaceships. These works don't just depict buildings—they construct them, character by character, following the logic of their real counterparts. A wall is made of repeating blocks. A roof slopes at architectural angles. A tower rises through vertical accumulation.

This exhibition showcases ASCII works that embrace architecture as subject and method. These pieces demonstrate how limitation breeds invention—how the constraint of monospaced characters forces artists to think like architects, building up from foundation to spire.

**Artist**: jgs (Joan G. Stark)  
**Date**: 1998  
**Dimensions**: 45×19 characters  
**Technique**: Multi-tower composition  
**Character set**: ASCII printable

**Notes**: Joan Stark's castle demonstrates architectural thinking—the three towers are structurally distinct but visually unified. Flags (|>>), walls (|), battlements (/'\), and gates create a complete fortification. Note how the towers recede in scale, suggesting perspective.

**Artist**: Unknown  
**Date**: 2001  
**Dimensions**: 65×13 characters  
**Technique**: Varied heights, irregular roofline  
**Character set**: ASCII printable

**Notes**: Buildings of different heights create visual interest. The irregular skyline feels organic—like a real city grown over time. Windows (small rectangles) add detail without overwhelming. The ground line anchors everything.

**Artist**: Anonymous  
**Date**: 1997  
**Dimensions**: 50×17 characters  
**Technique**: Arch structure with support  
**Character set**: ASCII printable

**Notes**: The arch (made with parentheses and periods) demonstrates ASCII's ability to suggest curves through careful stepping. The vertical supports (pipes) and water (tildes) complete the structure. Balanced, stable composition.

```

**Artist**: Unknown  
**Date**: 1999  
**Dimensions**: 50×22 characters  
**Technique**: Gothic architecture elements  
**Character set**: ASCII printable

**Notes**: The pointed arch roof, tower with cross, and vertical emphasis evoke Gothic cathedrals. Forward slashes create the sloping roof—a common ASCII technique. The symmetry reinforces the sacred nature of the building.

**Dimensions**: 35×19 characters  
**Technique**: Industrial forms  
**Character set**: ASCII + Unicode cloud

**Notes**: Smokestacks with clouds, regular window grid, and loading bays suggest industrial architecture. The repetition of [] for windows creates monotony—fitting for factory aesthetic. Brackets for doors and grates add mechanical detail.

**Artist**: Anonymous  
**Date**: 1998  
**Dimensions**: 30×21 characters  
**Technique**: Tapered tower with light  
**Character set**: ASCII + Unicode colon for light

**Notes**: The light at top (colons creating radiance) identifies this as lighthouse. The tapered tower (getting wider toward base) suggests stability. Windows (O) are round—unusual in ASCII, effective here. Water line at bottom completes the scene.

**Dimensions**: 35×16 characters  
**Technique**: Modular construction  
**Character set**: ASCII printable

**Notes**: Space stations are ideal ASCII subjects—modular, geometric, constructed from repeated elements. This design shows connected modules (cylinders with brackets), solar panels (equals signs), and a docking bay. The symmetry suggests human engineering in space.

**Dimensions**: 55×19 characters  
**Technique**: Repeated arches  
**Character set**: ASCII printable

**Notes**: Roman architecture's repetitive arches translate perfectly to ASCII. Three tiers of arches decrease in size, demonstrating structural logic—wider bases support upper levels. The water channel at top and ground water at bottom frame the structure.

**Artist**: Unknown  
**Date**: 2012  
**Dimensions**: 45×24 characters  
**Technique**: Stacked sections  
**Character set**: ASCII + Unicode colons

**Notes**: Modern skyscrapers built through stacked sections of decreasing size. Each section has its own window style—vertical (||), horizontal (=), punctuation (:)—suggesting different architectural eras or functions within the building.

## Architectural Techniques

### Structural Elements

**Walls**: | (vertical), _ (horizontal), - (horizontal thin)  
**Roofs**: /\ (peaked), ___ (flat), /~~\ (curved)  
**Windows**: [] (square), O (round), : (small), || (vertical panes)  
**Doors**: | | (open), [_] (closed), ==== (garage/large)  
**Foundations**: ___ (floor), ~~~ (on water), === (reinforced)

### Perspective

**Isometric**: Using / and \ to create 3D appearance without vanishing point. Common for buildings viewed from angle.

**Elevation**: Straight-on view—front, side, or back of building. Simpler but less dynamic.

**Aerial**: Looking down from above—floor plans or cityscape views.

### Scale and Proportion

**Human scale**: Buildings should feel right for implied human size—doors should be smaller than walls, windows should align in rows.

**Relative scale**: In cityscapes, buildings should vary in height realistically—not all skyscrapers, not all cottages.

**Detail density**: Larger buildings need more detail (more windows, architectural elements) to justify their size.

### Historical Styles

**Classical**: Columns (|||), capitals (decorative tops), symmetry, pediments (triangular roof sections)

**Gothic**: Pointed arches, vertical emphasis, flying buttresses (diagonal supports), crosses

**Modern**: Glass curtain walls (repeated colons or dots), geometric forms, flat roofs, minimal ornament

**Industrial**: Smokestacks, rectangular forms, regular window grids, functional appearance

**Futuristic**: Curved forms (parentheses), geometric complexity, modular construction, unconventional symmetry

---

## Why Architecture Works in ASCII

1. **Structural logic**: Buildings are built from repeated elements—bricks, windows, floors. ASCII's grid of repeated characters mirrors this.

2. **Geometric forms**: Architecture relies on triangles, rectangles, circles—shapes ASCII can suggest through character arrangement.

3. **Visual hierarchy**: Buildings have clear foreground/background, base/roof, structure/ornament. ASCII's limited palette forces clear hierarchy.

4. **Cultural recognition**: A few elements (door, window, roof) are enough for recognition—ASCII's minimalism is sufficient.

5. **Modular thinking**: Both architects and ASCII artists think in modules—repeated elements that combine into larger wholes.

---

## Historical Note

Architectural ASCII has appeared throughout the form's history:

**1960s-70s**: Computer-generated architectural drawings printed as ASCII—precursors to CAD.

**1980s**: BBS login screens often featured castles, houses, or cityscapes—welcoming users "home."

**1990s**: Email signatures with houses, churches, or fantasy castles were common.

**2000s**: Minecraft ASCII art explored architectural representation at larger scales.

**2010s+**: Terminal UIs and ASCII games continue architectural tradition.

Architecture remains one of ASCII art's most successful subjects—proof that constraint and structure can be generative, not limiting.
