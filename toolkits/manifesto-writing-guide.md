# Manifesto Writing Guide

## Introduction

A manifesto is a **public declaration of intentions, motives, or views**.

It is:
- **Bold** - Takes a clear position
- **Urgent** - Demands attention
- **Actionable** - Inspires response
- **Collective** - Speaks to/for a community

This guide helps you write manifestos that matter: personal declarations, community statements, political positions, or artistic visions.

---

## What Makes a Good Manifesto?

### 1. Clear Position

**Take a stand:**
- What do you believe?
- What are you for/against?
- No hedging, no "maybe"

**Example:**
```
Bad:  "We think technology might sometimes be problematic."
Good: "We reject surveillance capitalism."
```

### 2. Urgency

**Why now?**
- What's at stake?
- Why can't this wait?
- Create sense of necessity

**Example:**
```
"The web is being enclosed. Every day, more of our digital commons 
becomes corporate property. We must act now."
```

### 3. Vision

**Show the alternative:**
- What world do you want?
- What does success look like?
- Paint the picture

**Example:**
```
"We envision a web where:
- Your data is yours
- Surveillance is illegal
- Communities, not corporations, make decisions"
```

### 4. Call to Action

**What should readers do?**
- Concrete steps
- Immediate actions
- Long-term goals

**Example:**
```
"Starting today:
- Delete your Facebook account
- Switch to Signal
- Host your own website"
```

## Types of Manifestos

### 1. Personal Manifesto

**Purpose:** Define your values, work, life philosophy

**Structure:**
- I believe...
- I stand for...
- I will...
- I refuse...

**Example:**
```
# My Digital Practice Manifesto

I believe:
- Code is a form of writing
- Plain text outlasts all formats
- Privacy is a right, not a privilege

I stand for:
- Open source over proprietary
- Federation over centralization
- Users over advertisers

I will:
- Release my work under free licenses
- Document my process
- Share knowledge freely

I refuse:
- To build surveillance tools
- To accept "terms of service" as law
- To let convenience override ethics
```

**Audience:** Yourself (clarity), potential collaborators/employers

### 2. Collective Manifesto

**Purpose:** Define group identity, shared values, goals

**Structure:**
- We are...
- We believe...
- We demand...
- We will...

**Example:**
```
# Terminal Aesthetics Collective

We are designers, developers, artists who believe the terminal is 
a valid canvas for creative expression.

We believe:
- Beauty exists in constraint
- Monospace fonts are elegant
- Function and form are inseparable

We demand:
- Recognition of text-based art
- Preservation of terminal culture
- Access to fast, lightweight tools

We will:
- Create and share terminal art
- Build tools that respect users
- Teach the next generation
```

**Audience:** Members (unity), public (recruitment, awareness)

### 3. Political Manifesto

**Purpose:** Demand change, challenge power, mobilize action

**Structure:**
- The problem (diagnosis)
- Why it matters (urgency)
- Our demands (solution)
- How to fight (action)

**Example:**
```
# Against Algorithmic Feeds

The Problem:
Algorithmic feeds manipulate what we see, shaping our reality 
for corporate profit. We don't control our attention anymore—
algorithms do.

Why It Matters:
Democracy requires informed citizens. When corporations decide 
what information reaches us, democracy dies.

Our Demands:
- Ban engagement-maximizing algorithms
- Mandate chronological feeds
- Give users algorithmic transparency
- Break up platform monopolies

How to Fight:
- Use chronological-only platforms (Mastodon, etc.)
- Demand legislation
- Support anti-monopoly movements
- Build alternatives
```

**Audience:** Public, policymakers, movements

### 4. Artistic Manifesto

**Purpose:** Define aesthetic position, challenge norms, inspire

**Structure:**
- Against... (what you reject)
- For... (what you embrace)
- We create... (methods)
- Join us... (invitation)

**Example:**
```
# The Ditherpunk Manifesto

Against:
- High-resolution bloat
- Photorealistic obsession
- File size waste
- Bandwidth inequality

For:
- 1-bit aesthetics
- Dithered beauty
- Efficient images
- Global accessibility

We create:
- Art from constraints
- Beauty from limits
- Meaning from reduction
- Style from necessity

Join us:
- Dither your images
- Embrace monochrome
- Share your work
- Build the low-bandwidth web
```

**Audience:** Artists, designers, community

## Structure and Format

### Classic Manifesto Structure

**1. Title**
- Bold, declarative
- "Manifesto of X"
- "Against Y"
- "For Z"

**2. Opening Statement**
- Hook the reader
- State the problem or vision
- Create urgency

**3. Body (Numbered Points)**
- Clear, short statements
- Each point = one idea
- Build momentum

**4. Conclusion**
- Restate core message
- Issue call to action
- Memorable closing line

**Example:**
```
# The Slow Web Manifesto

The web has become fast—too fast. We click, scroll, swipe without 
thinking. Sites load in milliseconds, but we retain nothing. We 
demand a slower web.

1. Speed is not always better. Sometimes slow is intentional.

2. Attention is finite. Infinite scroll is theft.

3. Reading takes time. Respect that time.

4. Creating takes time. Respect that time.

5. Thinking takes time. Respect that time.

Conclusion:
We choose slow. We choose depth. We choose presence. Join us in 
slowing down the web. One page at a time.

Slow down. Stay present. Think deeply.
```

### Alternative Structures

**Listicle Style:**
```
# 10 Principles of Open Source Design

1. Transparency: All design decisions documented
2. Collaboration: Anyone can contribute
3. Iteration: Continuous improvement
...
10. Community: Design serves users, not profits
```

**Dialogue/Q&A:**
```
# FAQ: Why We Use Plain Text

Q: Why plain text?
A: Because it lasts forever.

Q: What about formatting?
A: Markdown gives us structure without complexity.

Q: Isn't this limiting?
A: Constraints enable creativity...
```

**Narrative:**
```
# A Story of Resistance

Once, the web was open. Anyone could make a page. Then came the 
platforms. They promised ease but delivered enclosure. Now we 
fight back...
```

---

## Writing Techniques

### 1. Use Strong Verbs

**Weak:**
```
"We think digital surveillance is possibly not ideal."
```

**Strong:**
```
"We reject digital surveillance."
"We refuse mass monitoring."
"We demand privacy."
```

### 2. Parallel Structure

**Creates rhythm:**
```
"We build tools that respect users.
We build tools that last.
We build tools that liberate."
```

### 3. Repetition

**For emphasis:**
```
"No more corporate platforms.
No more walled gardens.
No more algorithmic feeds.
No more."
```

### 4. Contrast

**Us vs. them:**
```
"They offer convenience. We offer freedom.
They offer scale. We offer community.
They offer profit. We offer purpose."
```

### 5. Concrete Language

**Avoid abstractions:**
```
Bad:  "Utilize digital platforms with intentionality."
Good: "Choose your tools carefully."

Bad:  "Implement resistance strategies."
Good: "Delete Facebook. Host your own site."
```

### 6. Short Sentences

**Punch, don't meander:**
```
"We resist. We create. We endure."
```

### 7. Rhetorical Questions

**Engage the reader:**
```
"What is a platform without users? Nothing.
What is a user without freedom? A product.
What is freedom without privacy? Impossible."
```

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Brainstorm (30 min)

**Free-write answers:**
- What do I believe?
- What am I against?
- What world do I want?
- What must change?
- What will I do?

**Don't edit. Just write.**

### Step 2: Identify Core Message (15 min)

**From brainstorm, extract:**
- 1 core belief
- 1 main demand
- 1 key action

**Example:**
- Belief: Privacy is a right
- Demand: Ban surveillance capitalism
- Action: Use encrypted tools

### Step 3: Outline (30 min)

**Choose structure:**
- Numbered points? (1, 2, 3...)
- Sections? (Problem, Solution, Action)
- Narrative? (Story with message)

**Sketch outline:**
```
1. Opening (hook)
2. Core principles (3-10 points)
3. Call to action
4. Closing (memorable line)
```

### Step 4: Draft (60-90 min)

**Write quickly:**
- Don't edit yet
- Get ideas on page
- Embrace messy first draft

**Aim for:**
- 500-1500 words (short manifestos work best)
- Strong opening and closing
- Clear position

### Step 5: Edit (60 min)

**Cut ruthlessly:**
- Remove weak verbs
- Delete hedging ("maybe," "possibly," "kind of")
- Eliminate repetition (unless intentional)
- Simplify complex sentences

**Strengthen:**
- Add concrete examples
- Use active voice
- Create rhythm (parallel structure, repetition)
- End strong

### Step 6: Test (30 min)

**Read aloud:**
- Does it sound powerful?
- Does it flow?
- Where does energy drop?

**Get feedback:**
- Share with trusted friend
- Ask: Clear? Compelling? Actionable?

### Step 7: Publish

**Share widely:**
- Personal blog/website
- GitHub (digital manifestos)
- Social media (excerpts)
- Print (zines, flyers, posters)

**Make it accessible:**
- Plain text version
- PDF
- HTML
- Multiple formats

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Too Vague

**Problem:**
```
"We believe in making things better and creating positive change."
```

**Solution:**
Specificity. Name the problem, solution, action.

### 2. Too Long

**Problem:**
10-page manifesto that loses reader attention.

**Solution:**
Edit brutally. 1-2 pages ideal. Save details for essays.

### 3. No Action

**Problem:**
Philosophy without practice.

**Solution:**
Always include "What to do now."

### 4. Preaching to Converted

**Problem:**
Only people who already agree will understand.

**Solution:**
Write for someone who's skeptical but curious.

### 5. Defensive Tone

**Problem:**
Spending more time refuting criticism than stating position.

**Solution:**
Lead with vision, not defensiveness.

### 6. Jargon

**Problem:**
"We must deterritorialize the rhizomatic assemblages of late capitalism."

**Solution:**
Plain language. If you can't explain simply, you don't understand it.

## Final Thoughts

**A manifesto is:**
- A stake in the ground
- A line you won't cross
- A flag you plant

**It's not:**
- The final word (you'll evolve)
- For everyone (some will disagree)
- Enough on its own (action required)

**Write yours. Share it. Live it.**
